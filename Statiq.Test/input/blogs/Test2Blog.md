![logo](/blogs/images/re-motion_White_RGB_260x50.png)

re-mix (formerly known as re-motion mixins) has been published to CodePlex. The link is http://remix.codeplex.com

Similar to re-linq, the source code repository will still be part of the re-motion project. The source code and binaries of a “mixin release” will be published to CodePlex.

The re-mix page on CodePlex will also contain additional documentation to Mixins.
